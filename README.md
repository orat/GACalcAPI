## Description
With GACalcAPI a service provider interface (SPI) is established to integrate symbolic GA implementations into domain specific languages (DSL) to work with geometric algebra. Its default implementation [CGACasADi](https://github.com/orat/CGACasADi) allows to generate c-code without any dependencies to any library. Thus it is possible to use generated implementations of GA based algorithms outside the Java world.
